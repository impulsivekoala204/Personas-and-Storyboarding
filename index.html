            <h3><b>Waffle Maker</b></h3>
            <p class = "description">
                The interface I picked the waffle maker at the Vdub for this project. This was because the interface
                had some non-obvious and slightly complex functions that i thought would be ideal for observation.

            <h2 class = "small-head" id = "l3">ANSWERS</h2>
            <ul class = "list-one">
                <li>I only use it occasionally. Waffles aren't usually what i eat for any meal. Maybe more often when I come for breakfast so maybe like 3-4 times a week</li>
                <li>Yeah its a bit confusing like I didn't know I had to flip it over and I was just standing there for a minute before someone told me.</li>
                <li>It's kind of fun. I like pouring the mixture and like making it myself.</li>
                <li>I don't really like how its made. Like there's a lot of stuff going on and it looks kind of intimidating.</li>
                <li>I think its hard if you're using it for the first time. I see the instructions on the back but its covered by the waffle maker. Also its kind of dark and hard to read.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class = "small-head" id = "l4">KEY OBSERVATIONS</h2>
            <p>I recorded mixed observations from the users. The device was used occassionally by most users with one first time user as well. Most of them mentioned a different experience with the interface the first time they used it
            which might imply a learning curve. The interface also has some steps before and after using it(making mixture, adding toppings) which made it a part of a bigger process. One user placed more emphasis on the process. At the end,
            2/3 users said that they would recommend the device to another person looking to buy.
